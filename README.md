#Vaccine Usage Prediction


Overview

Subjects receiving the same vaccine often show different levels of immune responses
and some may even present adverse side effects to the vaccine. Systems vaccinology can
combine omics data and machine learning techniques to obtain highly predictive
signatures of vaccine immunogenicity and reactogenicity. Currently, several machine
learning methods are already available to researchers with no background in
bioinformatics.

Objective

Predict the likelihood of people taking an H1N1 flu vaccine using logistic regression model.

Scope

● Exploratory data analysis
● Data Pre-processing
● Training logistic regression model with MLE and SGD for prediction
